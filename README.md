# CapyCollege

### Things to do



### HOMEPAGE
- make it more cutesty i would say more pixelated


### CAPYBARA widget
- make a capybara widget on the side the more jobs you apply the capybara stays happy,
   like every job you apply you you feed the capybara a new fruit/ vegetable and it makes it happier

- if you ruin your daily streak of applying to jobs them your capy becomes unhappy and sad
- the moment u become employed your cappy has a dance party (DISCO MODE)

### BACKEND THINGS TO DO ( p.s suggest store it in json files but mongodb is more sustainable) 
- store the users applied jobs in a db, with the dynamic status
- create apis to connect the db to web page

### COOL THINGS
- resume reviewer / convert to correct format something we can add later but yea def focus on first storing all the data once that works we can acc do stuff
